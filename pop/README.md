# Pop-cli for the Proof-of-Personhood party

This is the CLI for using the party-transcript. If you're an attendee, you
can simply have a look at [../README.md]. If you want to set up your own
PoP-party, here is a short rundown on what you need to do:

1. Set up two or more conodes
2. Link your computer to your conode
3. Create and store a configuration for the party
4. Add public keys
5. Finalize
